  <p>
    Snake: Evolution is a simple browser game where you control a snake to eat food, grow longer,
    and avoid crashing. This version adds a unique twist — the snake can temporarily evolve special
    abilities such as passing through walls. The game also features Start, Pause/Resume, and Reset
    controls for better gameplay experience.
